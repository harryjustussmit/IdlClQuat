# IdlClQuat

Description
--

A package for Magma to compute equivalence classes of ideals in quaternion algebras, also the non-invertible ones, and the related Brandt matrices.

For the theory on which this code is based see the `References` section at the bottom.

Please send comments and bug reports to `harryjustussmit@gmail.com` or `stefano.marseglia89@gmail.com`.

For complete descriptions and more details we refer to the [`List of commands`](https://github.com/harryjustussmit/IdlClQuat/blob/main/doc/ListOfCommands.md).

Some functionalities require the package [`hermite`](https://github.com/dansme/hermite) (developed by D. Smertnig and J. Voight) to be installed and attached in Magma. 


In the [`file`](https://github.com/harryjustussmit/IdlClQuat/blob/main/examples/example_brandt_matr.m) there is code to see how to use the main functions of the package.
