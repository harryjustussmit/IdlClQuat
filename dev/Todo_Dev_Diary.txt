### TODO Coding ###
- MORE TESTS!!!!
- Implement OverOrders and TraceDualIdeal.
- Compute weak equivalence classes by recursively looping over the maximal submodules of O'/ff with trivial extension.
- Make intrinsics for the (weak) equivalence classes that loop over all overorders. (Could the corresponding Brandt matrices be commutative?)

### DONE kept for record ###
- Rename WeakEquivalenceClasses with something like WeakEquivalenceClassesWithPrescribedOrder. I think it is better.
- The same for EquivalenceClasses.
